# Personal Website

A website for my own personal use. The Internet's got a lot of walled gardens these days and id like to have my own garden, where I can plant my own ideas.

## Goals

#### Nothing too specific.

A place to hold self hosted services like my own files and a backup git repo.

A place to talk about things I think about and where I can do what I wish.

Email redirect is useful just so my email address is very simple. *@samuelkurtzer.com gets directed to whatever email service I'm using.


## Stack

The main sections of The site are built in Django, which is a python framework. Its a bit bulky for The work that its doing currently but if in The future I need some of its features it will of been a good choice (over something like flask).

Apache is my server of choice. While nginx could of been better for The multithreading I know more Apache and changing over later wont be a huge hassle, although I might have a bit of trouble serving my static files.

I'm hosting it on a Ubuntu server. The Linux distro doesn't matter much to me, as long as its got a ~~package manager~~ git.
